Prototype instructions:
When launching, it will start up scene one. Using the left joystick, direct the boat down the stream from its starting position and have it meet the white wall. When colliding, it will launch the next scene. There is an audible pop sound to confirm this. In the next scene, the X/Y buttons on the left controller will move the boat forward and backward. Additionally the B/A buttons on the right controller will move the boat left and right. Navigate the same path again to trigger the final scene. In the final scene, place down the controllers. If you donâ€™t see your hands, move them behind your back and back in front of your point of view. This should bring up the hand interaction. A left thumbs up will move the boat left, a right thumbs up will move the boat right, and a left fist will move the boat forward. Follow the same path a final time, and when finished, it will prompt you to remove the headset.
